      <description>I recently happened to read two books in close succession that, unbeknownst to me before my readings, were both what I&amp;rsquo;m calling literary social science&amp;mdash;which is particularly striking given that one book is fiction and the other is a memoir. Anna Burns&amp;rsquo; Milkman is a fictional narrative by a teenager in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and Anna Wiener&amp;rsquo;s Uncanny Valley is a memoir of Wiener&amp;rsquo;s stint working in Silicon Valley.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an NYC-based data scientist who does research and education on responsible AI. Prior to this, I wrote developer-oriented and user-facing documentation. An even longer time ago, I got a PhD in philosophy after stints in computer vision and physics.</description>
