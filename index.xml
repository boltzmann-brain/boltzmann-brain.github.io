      <title>Der Spiegel&#39;s 1987 interview with Joseph Weizenbaum</title>

      <description>A few years ago, I found this 1987 interview with the early AI researcher-turned-AI skeptic Joseph Weizenbaum. It covers a lot of ground, such as the military-industrial complex, whether computers can capture human experience, and other points that today&amp;rsquo;s AI skeptics will be sympathetic to. (These themes were also covered in longer form in his book, Computer Power and Human Reason.) As far as I know, there isn&amp;rsquo;t an English translation of this interview available.</description>

      <title>My journey from academia into technical writing</title>

      <description>Occasionally, unhappy academics ask me for advice on how to get non-academic jobs. Few of them consider technical writing as a career option, and I think more of them should&amp;mdash;technical writing values skills that many academics already have, and provides similar intellectual challenges, but with greater career flexibility than academia has.
Here, I&amp;rsquo;ll describe my journey into technical writing and why I found it fulfilling, adding on some basic advice and views on the technical writing job market.</description>

      <description>Lizzie Kumar and I recently co-authored a paper at FAccT that applied feminist epistemology to explanation methods in machine learning. People must have liked it, because we won a best paper award for it. One of the points we made, borrowing from feminist epistemology, is that we could do with more epistemological pluralism when it comes to evaluating these methods, and that we should consider if certain dominant computing values cause us to over-trust some explanation methods.</description>

      <description>There was no shortage of women who entered my PhD program wanting to do philosophy of physics. There were as many of them, in my time there, as there were men interested in the same. Yet in the end, much fewer women ended up specializing in that, by the time they left the program.
Why? Here&amp;rsquo;s what would happen:
  A woman would be admitted with a philosophy of physics interest and enthusiastically start taking the philosophy of physics courses.</description>

      <title>Why I Don&#39;t Defend Professional Philosophy</title>
      <link>https://boltzmann-brain.github.io/posts/ethics/</link>

      <description>As a former professional philosopher who now does research on responsible AI, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to multiple events where someone working on the social impacts of AI will make a negative remark about philosophy. Typically, their criticism implicitly targets the dominant strain of academic philosophy in the Anglophone tradition, encompassing the various analytic approaches to ethics. As an ex-philosopher who finds my background in philosophy of science sometimes useful to my AI research, I might be expected to defend my former field, but in fact I largely agree with the criticisms and think on the whole that it would not be helpful to respond to these criticisms by listing the various &amp;ldquo;exceptions&amp;rdquo; to the rule.</description>

      <title>Literary Social Science in Milkman and Uncanny Valley</title>
      <link>https://boltzmann-brain.github.io/posts/milkman-uncanny-valley/</link>

      <description>I recently happened to read two books in close succession that, unbeknownst to me before my readings, were both what I&amp;rsquo;m calling literary social science&amp;mdash;which is particularly striking given that one book is fiction and the other is a memoir. Anna Burns&#39; Milkman is a fictional narrative by a teenager in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and Anna Wiener&amp;rsquo;s Uncanny Valley is a memoir of Wiener&amp;rsquo;s stint working in Silicon Valley.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a data scientist who does interdisciplinary research on responsible AI and helps data science teams make their models more explainable. I excel at bringing a humanistic perspective to technical issues while also having the skills to implement technical solutions that take social values into account. My research has won best paper awards at both FAccT and the Philosophy of Science Association.
Prior to this, I was a technical writer for a variety of software products, ranging from MLOps to REST APIs to complicated enterprise GUIs.</description>
