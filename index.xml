      <title>Why I Don&#39;t Defend Professional Philosophy</title>

      <description>As a former professional philosopher who now does research on responsible AI, I&amp;rsquo;ve been to multiple events where someone working on the social impacts of AI will make a negative remark about philosophy. Typically, their criticism implicitly targets the dominant strain of academic philosophy in the Anglophone tradition, encompassing the various analytic approaches to ethics. As an ex-philosopher who finds my background in philosophy of science sometimes useful to my AI research, I might be expected to defend my former field, but in fact I largely agree with the criticisms and think on the whole that it would not be helpful to respond to these criticisms by listing the various &amp;ldquo;exceptions&amp;rdquo; to the rule.</description>

      <title>Literary Social Science in Milkman and Uncanny Valley</title>

      <description>I recently happened to read two books in close succession that, unbeknownst to me before my readings, were both what I&amp;rsquo;m calling literary social science&amp;mdash;which is particularly striking given that one book is fiction and the other is a memoir. Anna Burns&amp;rsquo; Milkman is a fictional narrative by a teenager in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and Anna Wiener&amp;rsquo;s Uncanny Valley is a memoir of Wiener&amp;rsquo;s stint working in Silicon Valley.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an NYC-based data scientist who does research and education on responsible AI. Prior to this, I wrote developer-oriented and user-facing documentation. An even longer time ago, I got a PhD in philosophy after stints in computer vision and physics.</description>
