      <description>A few years ago, I found this 1987 interview with the early AI researcher-turned-AI skeptic Joseph Weizenbaum. It covers a lot of ground, such as the military-industrial complex, whether computers can capture human experience, and other points that today&amp;rsquo;s AI skeptics will be sympathetic to. (These themes were also covered in longer form in his book, Computer Power and Human Reason.) As far as I know, there isn&amp;rsquo;t an English translation of this interview available.</description>

      <description>I recently happened to read two books in close succession that, unbeknownst to me before my readings, were both what I&amp;rsquo;m calling literary social science&amp;mdash;which is particularly striking given that one book is fiction and the other is a memoir. Anna Burns&#39; Milkman is a fictional narrative by a teenager in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and Anna Wiener&amp;rsquo;s Uncanny Valley is a memoir of Wiener&amp;rsquo;s stint working in Silicon Valley.</description>
